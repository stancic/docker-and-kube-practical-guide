# Docker & Kubernetes: The Practical Guide [2022 Edition] By Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller / Academind GmbH

Here I'll push every task that I do in each of the sections.

First check if you have docker installed by running:

```
docker -v
```

If nothing shows up check the download links here:

macOS - [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)

Windows - [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

Linux - [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

All the notes that I've written will be linked to notion after I finish this course.
